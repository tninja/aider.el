Two games were written with the assistance of aider / aider.el

- [[./battleship][battleship]] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
  - 2.5h to write the game with human vs. human mode
    - using DeepSeek model
  - 1.5h to iterate and add human vs. computer mode
    - using Claude model
- [[./connect4][connect4]] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four
  - 0.5h to write the game with basic human vs. computer mode
  - 0.5h to iterate the AI and make it more effective
  - all using Claude model

- These games are CLI-based text games. In the future, I plan to create graphical versions using pygame, with the help of aider and aider.el
