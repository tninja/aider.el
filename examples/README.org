Two games were written with assistance of aider / aider.el

- [[./battleship][battleship]] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
  - 2.5h to write the game with human vs human mode
    - using deepseek model
  - 1.5h to iterate and add human vs computer mode
    - using claude model
- [[./connect4][connect4]] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four
  - 0.5h to write the game with basic human vs computer mode
  - 0.5h to iterate the AI and make it acceptable
  - all use claude model

- These games are just CLI based text game. Maybe in future I can try to make them using graphical mode with pygame, with the help of aider and aider.el
