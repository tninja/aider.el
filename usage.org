* How to integrate aider.el into development workflow

- Here I just share my own experience. You might have better way to use aider.el.

** Feature development

To develop new features effectively with aider.el, follow these steps:
1. Start an Aider session specific to your current git repository by running the command “aider-run-aider”. This links your session to your project context.

2. Add relevant files to the session using commands such as “aider-add-current-file”, “aider-add-files-in-current-window”, or “aider-add-same-type-files-under-dir” so that the AI has access to the complete codebase.

3. Use the code change commands—for example, “aider-code-change” or “aider-architect-discussion”—to articulate your new feature requirements and proposed changes.

4. Validate and evolve your feature with test-driven commands like “aider-write-unit-test” and “aider-fix-failing-test-under-cursor” as needed.

For more details, see the corresponding Feature development description in README.org.
