#+TITLE: aider.el : aider (AI Pair Programming) Inside Emacs

* Introduction

- Do you enjoy the AI features of the [[https://www.cursor.com/][Cursor AI Code Editor]] but prefer working within Emacs?

- [[https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider][Aider]] is a well-known and highly effective AI pair programming tool for the terminal.

- The `aider.el` package offers an interactive interface to communicate with Aider in Emacs.
  - Most of the Elisp code in this repository was generated by Aider or `aider.el`.

* Why Use `aider.el` in Emacs?

- Pop-up Menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)

[[file:./transient_menu.png]]

- The following commands are integrated into the aider menu:

*** Aider session management:
  - (`aider-run-aider`): Creates a comint-based, *git repo-specific Aider session* for interactive conversation.
    - Git repository identification is based on the current file's path
    - Multiple Aider sessions can run simultaneously for different Git repositories
When being called with the universal argument (`C-u`), a prompt will offer the user to change the content of `aider-args` for this session.
  - (`aider-switch-to-buffer`): Switch to the Aider buffer.
    - use "^" in the menu to toggle open aider session in other window inside current frame, or open a dedicate frame for aider session

*** Model Selection:
  - (`aider-change-model`): Interactively select and change AI model in current aider session
  - Customize `aider-popular-models` to define your preferred models list. Default models are (as date of 2025-01-26):
    - gemini/gemini-exp-1206 (free)
    - anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (really good in practical)
    - r1 (performance matches o1, price << claude sonnet. weakness: small context)
    - deepseek/deepseek-chat (chatgpt-4o level performance, price is 1/100. weakness: small context)
    - gpt-4o-mini

*** More ways to add files to the Aider buffer:
  - use "@" in the menu to toggle add file between read-write mode and read-only mode
  - (`aider-add-current-file`): Add the current buffer file.
  - (`aider-add-files-in-current-window`): Add all buffers in the current window.
  - (`aider-add-same-type-files-under-dir`): Add all files with the same suffix as the current file under the current directory to Aider.
  - (`aider-batch-add-dired-marked-files`): Add multiple Dired marked files to the Aider buffer.

*** Write code:
  - (`aider-function-or-region-refactor`): If a region is selected, ask Aider to refactor the selected region. Otherwise, ask Aider to change / refactor the function under the cursor.
  - (`aider-implement-todo`): Implement TODO comments in current context. If cursor is inside a function, implement TODOs for that function. Otherwise implement TODOs for the entire current file.

*** Explain code:
  - (`aider-ask-question`): Ask Aider a question about the code in the current context. If a region is selected, use the region as context.
  - (`aider-function-or-region-explain`): If a region is selected, ask Aider to explain the selected region. Otherwise, ask Aider to explain the function under the cursor.
  - (`aider-explain-symbol-under-point`): Ask Aider to explain the symbol under cursor, given the line as context.

*** Support for Test Driven Development:
  - (`aider-write-unit-test`): Generate comprehensive unit tests for the current function or file. The generated tests will include normal cases, edge cases, and error handling scenarios.
  - (`aider-fix-failing-test-under-cursor`): Place cursor on a failing test function and ask Aider to analyze and fix the code to make tests pass.

*** And More:
You can add your own Elisp functions to support your specific use cases. Feel free to ask Aider/`aider.el` to help you create them.

#+END_SRC

** Doom Installation and Configuration

- Add the following code to your doom/packages.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! aider :recipe (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el" "aider-doom.el")))
#+END_SRC

  :config
  (setq aider-args '("--model" "gpt-4o-mini")))
#+END_SRC

The aider prefix is "A".

[[file:./doom-menus.png]]

** Optional

*** Helm Support

Helm enables fuzzy searching functionality for command history prompts

You can enable Helm-based completion with the following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package aider
    :straight (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el" "aider-helm.el")))
#+END_SRC

*** Aider script interactive mode: aider-minor-mode

- If you prefer writing Aider commands in a separate file and sending them to an Aider session (similar to working with Python or R scripts and sending code blocks to a REPL), you might want to try aider-minor-mode. It provides the following key bindings:
  - C-c C-n: If region is active, send selected region line by line; otherwise, send current line
  - C-c C-c: Send current region line by line to aider session
  - C-c C-r: Send current region as a single block to aider session
  - Enable aider-minor-mode for your editing buffer
  - To automatically enable aider-minor-mode for any file with "aider" in its filename:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'find-file-hook
            (lambda ()
              (when (and (buffer-file-name)
                         (string-match-p "aider" (buffer-file-name)))
                (aider-minor-mode 1))))
#+END_SRC

* Screenshot

[[file:./screenshot.png]]

- The screenshot above shows Aider being asked to generate an aider-help function and add its corresponding entry to the menu (top right window).
- Aider successfully received the command and generated the appropriate commit (bottom left).
