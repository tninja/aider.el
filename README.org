#+TITLE: aider.el : aider (AI Pair Programming) Inside Emacs

* Introduction

- Do you enjoy the AI features of the [[https://www.cursor.com/][Cursor AI Code Editor]] but prefer working within Emacs?

- [[https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider][Aider]] is a well-known and highly effective AI pair programming tool for the terminal.

- The `aider.el` package offers an interactive interface to communicate with Aider in Emacs.
  - Most of the Elisp code in this repository was generated by Aider or `aider.el`.

* Benefits: UI, User-friendly UI, Context Awareness, AI-Assisted Code Development

- Pop-up Menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)

[[file:./transient_menu.png]]

- Work directly on the code without switching contexts — each file is automatically linked to a Git repository-specific Aider session.

- Pass your Emacs editing context to Aider, including details such as the active function or class and any selected code. This minimizes manual typing.

- Designed for everyday programming tasks, such as adding or modifying code with AI assistance, verifying the accuracy of AI-generated code, and reviewing code written by others.

* Installation

- Emacs need to be >= 26.1

** Vanilla Emacs Installation
- [[https://aider.chat/docs/install.html][Install aider]]
- Install the emacs dependency library [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]], and [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] using your package manager.
- Install aider.el with the following code:

*** With [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file][Straight]]
If you have Straight installed
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package aider
    :straight (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el"))
    :config
    ;; Use claude-3-5-sonnet cause it is best in aider benchmark
    (setq aider-args '("--model" "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"))
    (setenv "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" anthropic-api-key)
    ;; Or use chatgpt model since it is most well known
    ;; (setq aider-args '("--model" "o3-mini"))
    ;; (setenv "OPENAI_API_KEY" <your-openai-api-key>)
    ;; Or use gemini v2 model since it is very good and free
    ;; (setq aider-args '("--model" "gemini/gemini-exp-1206"))
    ;; (setenv "GEMINI_API_KEY" <your-gemini-api-key>)
    ;; Or use your personal config file
    ;; (setq aider-args `("--config" ,(expand-file-name "~/.aider.conf.yml")))
    ;; ;;
    ;; Optional: Set a key binding for the transient menu
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'aider-transient-menu))
#+END_SRC

*** With [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fetching-Package-Sources.html#:~:text=One%20way%20to%20do%20this,just%20like%20any%20other%20package.][package-vc-install]] (emacs built-in)
- Install Aider.el by running the following code within Emacs
  - You'll need to manually install the required packages, such as [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]], [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]], and helm.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package-vc-install '(aider :url "https://github.com/tninja/aider.el"))
#+END_SRC

The config part is as same as above straight one

** Doom Installation and Configuration

- Add the following code to your doom/packages.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! aider :recipe (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el" "aider-doom.el")))
#+END_SRC

- Adjust and add the following code to your doom/config.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package aider
  :config
  (setq aider-args '("--model" "o3-mini")))
#+END_SRC

The aider prefix is "A".

- Start and open the aider buffer: =[SPC] A o=
- Add the current file with =[SPC] A a c=
- Reset the aider session with =[SPC] A r=
[[file:./doom-menus.png]]

** Optional

*** Helm Support

Helm enables fuzzy searching functionality for command history prompts.

You can have helm-based completion with run the following code, after install helm library:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package aider
    :straight (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el" "aider-helm.el")))
#+END_SRC

*** Aider script interactive mode: aider-minor-mode

- If you prefer writing Aider commands in a separate file and sending them to an Aider session (similar to working with Python or R scripts and sending code blocks to a REPL), you might want to try aider-minor-mode. It provides the following key bindings:
  - C-c C-n: If region is active, send selected region line by line; otherwise, send current line
  - C-c C-c: Send current region line by line to aider session
  - C-c C-r: Send current region as a single block to aider session
  - Enable aider-minor-mode for your editing buffer
  - To automatically enable aider-minor-mode for any file with "aider" in its filename:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'find-file-hook
            (lambda ()
              (when (and (buffer-file-name)
                         (string-match-p "aider" (buffer-file-name)))
                (aider-minor-mode 1))))
#+END_SRC

* Most used features (integrated into the aider menu)

*** Aider session management:
  - (`aider-run-aider`): Creates a comint-based, *git repo-specific Aider session* for interactive conversation.
    - Git repository identification is based on the current file's path
    - Multiple Aider sessions can run simultaneously for different Git repositories
When being called with the universal argument (`C-u`), a prompt will offer the user to change the content of `aider-args` for this session.
  - (`aider-switch-to-buffer`): Switch to the Aider buffer.
    - use "^" in the menu to toggle open aider session in other window inside current frame, or open a dedicate frame for aider session

*** Model Selection:
  - (`aider-change-model`): Interactively select and change AI model in current aider session
  - Customize `aider-popular-models` to define your preferred models list. Default models are (as date of 2025-01-26):
    - anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (really good in practical)
    - o3-mini (new released. very powerful, not expensive)
    - gemini/gemini-exp-1206 (free)
    - r1 (performance matches o1, price << claude sonnet. weakness: small context)
    - deepseek/deepseek-chat (chatgpt-4o level performance, price is 1/100. weakness: small context)

*** More ways to add files to the Aider buffer:
  - use "@" in the menu to toggle add file between read-write mode and read-only mode
  - (`aider-add-current-file`): Add the current buffer file.
  - (`aider-add-files-in-current-window`): Add all buffers in the current window.
  - (`aider-add-same-type-files-under-dir`): Add all files with the same suffix as the current file under the current directory to Aider.
  - (`aider-batch-add-dired-marked-files`): Add multiple Dired marked files to the Aider buffer.

*** Write code:
  - (`aider-function-or-region-refactor`): If a region is selected, ask Aider to refactor the selected region. Otherwise, ask Aider to change / refactor the function under the cursor.
  - *(`aider-implement-todo`): Implement requirement in comments in-place, in current context.*
    - If cursor is on a comment line, implement that specific comment in-place.
    - If there is a selection region of multi-line comments, implement code for those comments in-place.
    - If cursor is inside a function, implement TODOs for that function.
    - Otherwise implement TODOs for the entire current file.

*** Explain code:
  - (`aider-ask-question`): Ask Aider a question about the code in the current context. If a region is selected, use the region as context.
  - (`aider-function-or-region-explain`): If a region is selected, ask Aider to explain the selected region. Otherwise, ask Aider to explain the function under the cursor.
  - (`aider-explain-symbol-under-point`): Ask Aider to explain the symbol under cursor, given the line as context.

*** Support for Unit Test / Test Driven Development:
  - (`aider-write-unit-test`): Generate comprehensive unit tests for the current function or file. If the cursor is on a test function, implement the test function.
  - (`aider-fix-failing-test-under-cursor`): Place cursor on a failing test function and ask Aider to analyze and fix the code to make tests pass. You can provide more information of failed test case to help aider figuring out how to fix the source code.

*** And More:
You can add your own Elisp functions to support your specific use cases. Feel free to ask Aider/`aider.el` to help you create them.

* FAQ

- How to enter multi-line prompts in aider session buffer?
  - aider itself support that, [[https://aider.chat/docs/usage/commands.html#entering-multi-line-chat-messages][doc]]. I used the tag way and it works well for me.
  - use a separate file for aider script to modify your multi-line prompts (you don't want them to go away right? especially if it is not perfect and need to be modified), and use aider-minor-mode to send the multi-line prompts to aider buffer.

* My personal development experience using aider.el

- Here I just share my personal experience. You might have different / better way to use aider.el.

** Feature development

1. Start an Aider session associated with the current Git repository by running the command “aider-run-aider”. This links the session to the project context.

2. Next, consider including relevant files in the session using commands like “aider-add-current-file” or “aider-add-files-in-current-window”. This supplies Aider with additional, useful context.

3. When making changes, you might be either adding new code or modifying existing code.
   - *Adding new code* via one-line comment implementation:
         For instance, suppose you encounter the following Python snippet:

         #+BEGIN_SRC python :eval never
         # TODO: Implement a function that checks if a number is prime
         #+END_SRC  

         With the cursor positioned on the TODO comment line, running “aider-implement-todo” will send only that inline comment to Aider, which may then generate revised code—for example, a complete implementation of an is_prime function—while preserving the existing code. For instance, Aider might produce:

         #+BEGIN_SRC python :eval never
         def is_prime(n):
             if n <= 1:
                 return False
             for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
                 if n % i == 0:
                     return False
             return True
         #+END_SRC  

         This example demonstrates how aider-implement-todo can assist in introducing new code. (This command may also be useful for some documentation tasks.)

     - If the suggested change is not completely satisfactory, you can decline it (for example, by entering "N"). After declining, use the “Ask Question” command (or type /ask in the aider session buffer) to request further modifications with detailed guidance. Once you receive an acceptable suggestion, confirm it using the “Go Ahead” command (or type "go ahead" in the aider session buffer).

   - *Change existing code* for an existing function, class, or code block:
     1. If you only need to modify a portion of the code, select the relevant region; otherwise, simply place the cursor inside the target function or class.
     2. Execute the “aider-function-or-region-refactor” command.
     3. When prompted, provide a clear description of the intended change (e.g., “Rename variable 'temp' to 'result'” or “Make the function static”).
     4. A revised version of the code, incorporating your suggestions, will be generated while preserving the overall structure.
     5. Review the output; if further refinement is required, request additional adjustments using “Ask Question” and confirm them with “Go Ahead” until the desired result is achieved.

   - Note: Alternative commands like `aider-architect-discussion` and `aider-code-change` are also available, though they may offer less context sensitivity than the commands described above.

4. *Generate tests*  
   It is recommended to validate and iteratively improve the feature using unit test commands such as “aider-write-unit-test” and “aider-fix-failing-test-under-cursor.” Although AI-generated code can provide a valuable starting point, it may sometimes introduce subtle issues. Running tests both before and after integrating changes ensures that each modification is verified. Running the full test suite after every change is advised to catch any issues early.

    (As an aside, a projectile function is currently employed to switch between the main code and test code and add them to the session—but further improvements to include test code seamlessly are always welcome.)

5. *Refactor code and tests*  
   Finally, you can further refactor the AI-generated code and tests as needed—either using additional prompts or manual adjustments—to best meet the project’s requirements.
