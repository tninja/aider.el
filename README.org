#+TITLE: aider.el : aider (AI Pair Programming) Inside Emacs 

* Introduction

- Do you like the AI features of [[https://www.cursor.com/][Cursor AI Code Editor]], but prefer to stay within Emacs?

- [[https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider][Aider]] is good AI pair programming in the terminal.

- aider.el provides an interactive interface to communicate with Aider in emacs.
  - Most of the Elisp code in this repository was generated by aider / aider.el.

* Why Use aider.el in Emacs?

- Pop-up Menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)

[[file:./transient_menu.png]]

- Git Repository-Specific aider Sessions in Emacs: Automatically identify the Git repository of the current file and create a new aider session for it. Multiple aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories.

- More ways to add files to aider buffer
  - Add current buffer file: (aider-add-current-file)
  - Add all buffers in current window: (aider-add-files-in-current-window)
  - Batch add files from dired buffer (aider-batch-add-dired-marked-files): Add multiple Dired marked files to the Aider buffer.

- Region-Based Explain / Refactor Support
  - Explain: (aider-region-explain): You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask aider to explain it.
  - Refactor: (aider-region-refactor): Ask aider to refactor it given your input instruction

- And More: Add your own Elisp functions to support your use case. You can certainly ask aider / aider.el to do that.

* Installation

** Vanilla Emacs Installation
- [[https://aider.chat/docs/install.html][Install aider]]
- Install the dependency [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] using your package manager.
- Install aider.el with the following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package aider
    :straight (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el"))
    :config
    (setq aider-args '("--model" "gpt-4o-mini"))
    (setenv "OPENAI_API_KEY" <your-openai-api-key>)
    ;; Optional: Set a key binding for the transient menu
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'aider-transient-menu))
#+END_SRC


** Doom Installation and Configuration

- Add the following code to your doom/packages.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! aider :recipe (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el")))
#+END_SRC

- Adjust and add the following code to your doom/config.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package aider
  :config
  (setq aider-args '("--model" "gpt-4o-mini")))
#+END_SRC

The aider prefix is "l".

- Start and open the aider buffer: =[SPC] l o=
- Add the current file with =[SPC] l a c=

[[file:./doom-menus.png]]

** Optional

- Maybe you might want to try aider-helm.el. That file added support of command history and completion from helm.

- If you enjoy writing aider command in a separate file and send them to aider session, just like working on python or R script and send code block into REPL, you might want to try aider-minor-mode. It by default bind C-c C-n to send current line to aider session, and C-c C-c to send current region to aider session.

- To automatically enable aider-minor-mode to any file with aider inside filename

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'find-file-hook
            (lambda ()
              (when (and (buffer-file-name)
                         (string-match-p "aider" (buffer-file-name)))
                (aider-minor-mode 1))))
#+END_SRC

* Screenshot

[[file:./screenshot.png]]

- In the above screenshot, aider was asked to generate an aider-help function and add the corresponding entry to the menu (top right window).
- aider received the command and generated the commit for it (bottom left).
