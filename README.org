#+TITLE: aider.el : aider (AI Pair Programming) Inside Emacs 

* Introduction

- Do you like the AI features of [[https://www.cursor.com/][Cursor AI Code Editor]], but prefer to stay within Emacs?

- [[https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider][Aider]] is good AI pair programming in the terminal.

- aider.el provides an interactive interface to communicate with Aider in emacs.
  - Most of the Elisp code in this repository was generated by aider / aider.el.

* Why Use aider.el in Emacs?

- Pop-up Menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)

- Git Repository-Specific aider Sessions in Emacs: Automatically identify the Git repository of the current file and create a new aider session for it. Multiple aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories.

- Region-Based Refactor Support: You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask aider to refactor it.

- And More: Add your own Elisp functions to support your use case. You can certainly ask aider / aider.el to do that.

* Installation

- [[https://aider.chat/docs/install.html][Install aider]]
- Install the dependency [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] using your package manager.
- Install aider.el with the following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package aider
    :straight (:host github :repo "tninja/aider.el" :files ("aider.el"))
    :config
    (setq aider-args '("--model" "gpt-4o-mini"))
    (setenv "OPENAI_API_KEY" <your-openai-api-key>)
    ;; Optional: Set a key binding for the transient menu
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'aider-transient-menu))
#+END_SRC
